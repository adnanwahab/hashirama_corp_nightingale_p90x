How To build an Autonomous Medical Vehicle?


How to reduce taxes by 30% 



Met bv, pl, mb, so make a blag they would think Is cool
Anduril figured it out - scrape linked in. And see how many ui devs they have 

Bret Victor - dnyamicland 
Entire building or environment is a computer
Instead of pushing a button = UI
Picking an object, saying a word or "magic Spell"
Is the UI

Magic spell = function and parameters = sicp

My new plan will lower taxes by 30.
And create 300 million jobs
And increase life expectancy by 15 years.
And it will

Will these make doctors and hospitals obsolete? 
No. Going to school and getting a medical degree will still grant you the power.

If anything, it would increase the demand for medical care because it would cease to be an unpleasant experience that is almost universally met with aversion. 

Initial business model : sell to apartment buildings and home owners associations.

How long did it take autonomous vehicles to become legal? About 10 years. They can spend 300 million per year. That's 3 billion to get to market. These robots will make driving 50% cheaper and much safer. 

Medical bots will make healthcare at least 66% cheaper and radically safer and more pleasant. 

But it will take even longer than self driving cars. It will take 15 or maybe even 30 years. 


Autonomous vehicle companies are famously capital intensive.

Moocs have democratized education. Now any 13 year old can take classes with Noam Chomsky and famous scientists like Tim Roughgarden.

A utopia is finally possible. That means a civilizations with no unnecessary physical or mental suffering. 

That means a city without war, violence, crime, disease, poverty, regret.

Dear FutureMe,

for the last 60 days, you have worked 90 hour weeks or 12 hours a day 

Thats good

1. now you have a great portfolio like bruno simon
2. now you have lost 10 pounds 
2. now you can enjoy life and travel while working at wherever.


you could go for a week to austin and a week to LA 


we could spend the next 10 weeks anywhere
should we go to austin or longbeach ?????

austin or long beach -> 2000 a month = all of unemployment
600 * 4 = 2400 

2 months = 5k 

5k + 4k 


Stick to routine for 6 months
